📈 MARKET INTELLIGENCE

💡 HOW IT WORKS:

1. DISCOVER OPPORTUNITIES
Browse our daily-updated draft boards showing mock draft rankings and card prices. Look for players rising in mocks but still affordable.

2. BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO
Scan your existing cards or track cards you're watching. Our AI recognizes thousands of players and sets automatically.

3. TRACK YOUR INVESTMENT
See real-time values, profit/loss, and portfolio performance. Get insights on when to buy, hold, or sell.

4. STAY AHEAD OF THE MARKET
Mock drafts predict card value movement weeks or months in advance. Be the first to know when a player's stock is rising.

🔍 WHY COLLECTORSTREAM?

Traditional card collecting relies on hindsight. By the time everyone knows a player is good, their cards are already expensive. Mock drafts show you which players experts think will succeed BEFORE they prove it on the field. That's your opportunity.

Our system monitors hundreds of mock drafts daily and compares draft position movement to current card market prices. When we find a gap, that's your signal.

✨ KEY FEATURES:
• Multi-sport draft board coverage
• AI card scanning and recognition
• Real-time portfolio tracking
• Price history and trends
• Profit/loss calculations
• Market opportunity alerts
• Beautiful dark mode interface
• Secure cloud sync
• No ads, ever

🎓 LEARNING RESOURCES:
• Understanding the Draft Gap concept
• How to read mock draft trends
• Timing your card purchases
• Portfolio diversification strategies
• Risk management for card investors
